info-dialog-text=Progressive Web Application developed with Java/Spring and Vaadin Framework. It simulates the module of an airport management system to demonstrate basic CRUD operations. The program is designed to work with a REST API and has several controllers implemented to scale it within the SOA paradigm. A MySQL database is used, and both it and the app are packaged in Docker.
